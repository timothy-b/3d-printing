# print profiles

Currently, the only difference between these profiles is speed. Both profiles are set to 20% infill as a sane default, although specific applications may call for 0%, 10%, 100%, or somewhere in between. The "Good Quality" profile could perhaps be slowed down by 20mm/s for better quality. 

These are optimized for PLA.
